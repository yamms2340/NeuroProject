She was the mother of Ganesha. One day, she wanted to take a bath, and she needed someone to guard the door so no one would bother her. So, she created a boy from sandalwood paste and breathed life into him. This boy was strong and brave, and she named him Ganesha.\n\nParvati told Ganesha, \"Guard the door and don't let anyone in while I'm bathing.\" Ganesha stood guard, just like his mother asked.\n\nSoon, Lord Shiva, Parvati's husband, came home. Ganesha didn't know who Shiva was and stopped him from entering. Shiva got very angry because Ganesha wouldn't let him see his wife.\n\nShiva and Ganesha argued, and then they started to fight! Shiva was very powerful, and in the end, he accidentally cut off Ganesha's head.\n\nParvati was heartbroken when she found out what happened. She explained to Shiva that Ganesha was their son and that she had created him to protect her.\n\nShiva felt terrible and promised to bring Ganesha back to life. He sent his helpers out to find the first animal they could find facing north. They found an elephant!\n\nShiva then took the elephant's head and placed it on Ganesha's body, bringing him back to life. That's why Ganesha has an elephant head!\n\nParvati was so happy to have her son back. Shiva blessed Ganesha and declared that before any prayer or important event, Ganesha would be worshipped first. That's why we always pray to Lord Ganesha before we start anything new!\n\nDid you like the story?\n"},
